					Each year, the world produces 300 million tons of plastic, much of
					which resists degradation and ends up polluting every corner of the
					globe. But a team of European scientists may have found a unique
					solution to the plastic problem. They discovered that a common insect
					can chew sizable holes in a plastic shopping bag within 40 minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					This study is another milestone discovery for the research on
					biodegradation of plastics,” says Wei-Min Wu, an environmental
					engineer at Stanford University.
				</p>
				<p>
					The discovery was led by Federica Bertocchini, a developmental
					biologist at the University of Cantabria in Spain. She first noticed
					the possibility as she cleaned out her backyard bee hives two years
					ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					She removed some wax worms (Galleria mellonella) living in the hive
					and placed them in an old plastic bag. When she checked the bag an
					hour later, however, she discovered small holes in the part of the bag
					with the larvae. Although Bertocchini wasn’t an entomologist, she
					guessed immediately what was happening
				</p>
				<p>
					The larval form of a small moth, wax worms get their names because
					they live on the wax in bee hives. Like plastic, wax is a polymer,
					which consists of a long string of carbon atoms held together, with
					other atoms branching off the sides of the chain. Both wax and the
					polyethylene in Bertocchini’s plastic bag had a similar carbon
					backbone.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Since they eat wax, they may have evolved a molecule to break it
					down, and that molecule might also work on plastic,” Bertocchini said.
				</p>
				<p>
					When they placed the worms on polyethylene plastic, they found that
					each worm created an average of 2.2 holes per hour. Overnight, 100 wax
					worms degraded 92 milligrams of a plastic shopping bag. At this rate,
					it would take these same 100 worms nearly a month to completely break
					down an average, 5.5 gram plastic bag.
